This assignment took me around 10 hours to complete, it was really fun and I learned alot of foundational javascript elements making this, I enjoyed doing it. For the questions i used https://www.interviewbit.com/javascript-mcq/#javascript-is-an-_______-language to get questions because I couldn't think of any.
